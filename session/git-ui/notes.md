# Rethinking Git UI (based on learnings from sapling and interactive smartlog)

## Notes

- Not necessarily new (i.e. patch series)
    - Reinvigorating an "old" workflow after having popularized PR/MR workflows
      for the past decade or so.
- 

## Questions

- What can sapling optimize for?
- Git interop?
- Stack based workflows?
- What is missing in the metadata / headers to enable a more stack-based / patch series workflow?
    - Putting these history 

## Issues

- Tracking commits between changes; i.e. 
    - `change-id`
    - Pointer to previous version to track history (adding another DAG)
    - Tooling to view this history (?) 
        - MercurialUI slowly introduces the user to the concept of this history;
